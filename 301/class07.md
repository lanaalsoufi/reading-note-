# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

A guy helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. What does a GET do?

Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET

5. What does a POST do?

If one system needs to add something to another system.

6. What does PUT do?

If a system wants to replace something in another system.

7. What does PATCH do?

If a system wants to do a partial update.
