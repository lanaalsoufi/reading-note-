# Mongo and Mongoose

## nosql vs sql

**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

***SQL***

* SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases

* SQL databases are table based databases whereas

* SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas

* SQL databases have predefined schema whereas

* SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas

***NoSQL***

* NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational

* NoSQL databases are document based

* NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents

* NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

* NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable

**1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

* the complex query intensive environment whereas

* heavy duty transactional type applications

**2. Give a real world example.**

MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.

**3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

**4. Give a real world example.**

MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.

**5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

**6. Which type of database is best for scalability?**

SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server.

## sql vs nosql (Video)

**1. What does SQL stand for?**

structured query language.

**2. What is a realational database?**

database which works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and it supports the SQL language the structured query language.

**3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

Structured Query Language like table , products table

**4. What is a ‘schema’?**

schema is defined by so-called fields.

**5. What is a NoSQL database?**

is a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first

**6. How does it work?**

we don't have tables but we have so-called documents, they look a bit like JSON. they don't have to use the same schema you can have multiple documents in one collection which have different fields.

**7. What is inside of a Mongo database?**

different documents in one and the same collection.

**8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB because it does not have to worry about transactions or rollbacks

**9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

you can put all the information in one place. you don't really need to query that connect data because you got the data you need in each collection. have less relation merging going on have super fast and efficient queries.
