## Growth-Mindest
 * The growth Mindest is the belief that a person is able to change his competencies, abilities and intelligence, while on the other hand, the fixed mentality does not believe that a person is able to change his competencies, abilities and intelligence.

* In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. ... In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence.

* Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts).

# 3 Reminders to myself to maintain a growth mindest :
- Working with others and work hard 
- Enter my mind with various challenges 
- Be positive
