For web development, you should download the text editor, as it is one of the important web developer tools, and everyone who uses a different text editor for the other is a personal choice, and they are very similar.  The text editor is a part of the program that we download and install on the computer and we can access it over the Internet through the web browser, and among the most important features of the text editor:1.) code completion; 2.) syntax highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them. You might find some other features that are must-haveâ€™s, but I think these features are a good start.One of the great features of any text editor is code completion and the ability to write HTML and CSS more efficiently.
